Hi! My name is Xinya Jiang (姜新雅). I am a first-year PhD student in the School of Journalism and Media at The University of Texas at Austin. I obtained my B.A. in Journalism and M.A. in Communication from Nanjing University.

I am interested in political communication and computational social science. More specifically, my on-going research focus on the following questions: (1) What’s the effects of media on political polarization and what’s the consequences? (2) Do algorithms and social interactions on social media aggravate opinion polarization and political polarization? (3) How powerful are narratives and emotions on social media? Do they promote the spread of hate speech and counter-speech?

I am interested in computational methods and quantitative methods. I usually use large-scale social media data and survey data. 

I have a white Samoyed dog named Laifu (来福, Meaning: Happiness comes to our family). She now lives happily in Huai’an, Jiangsu, where I was born and raised. In my spare time, I like bodybuilding and watching movies. *Daisy*, *The Lord of the Rings* and *Star Wars* are my favorite ones. I love listening to performances by sopranos and tenors. I am also a fan of *The Phantom of the Opera* (Musical). My favorite singers are Sia and Adele.

**I am happy for academic collaboration, feel free to contact me via email.**
