Hi! My name is Xinya Jiang (姜新雅). I am a second-year PhD student in the School of Journalism and Media at The University of Texas at Austin. I obtained my B.A. in Journalism and M.A. in Communication from Nanjing University.

I am interested in political communication and computational social science. Methodologically, I am interested in computational and quantitative methods. In recent research, I am also exploring causal inference.

I have a white Samoyed dog named Laifu (来福, Meaning: Happiness comes to our family). She now lives happily in Huai’an, Jiangsu, where I was born and raised.

**I am happy for academic collaboration, feel free to contact me via email.**
